# JS30 Challenge

I decided that it's about time I do the JavaScript30 challenge. 

[A 30 day Vanilla JS Coding challenge](https://javascript30.com/).

No Frameworks + No compilers + No libraries + No boilerplate

Each challenge folder contains a README detailing what I learned and a link to see the demo.
