## What did I learn

[Demo](https://eowino.github.io/JS30/CSSVariables/)

### CSS variables

I had seen the syntax before but never actually used it as the projects I had worked on before always
had to support browsers that didn't support CSS variables.

### HTMLElement.dataset

A propert on an HTMLElement that provides custome read/write access to all custom data attributes
(`data-*`) set on the element.
